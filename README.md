# CalcLang - The Esoteric Math Language
CalcLang is a simple but niche language built in Java that allows for basic arithmetic operations, looping, and conditional statements. It is not designed to be easy use, but to explore a different approach to programming. It has limited capability, but can preform loops and conditional statements.

## Introduction
This is a java-based esoteric language where mathematical statements are used instead of traditional code. There are arthimatic operators and keywords for controling code flow. There is only one real datatype which are rational numbers. These numbers can be printed as characters, however. 

## Key Features
- **Mathematical Statements as Code**: Instead of traditional code, mathematical statements are used.
- **Innovative Syntax**: The language syntax uses several operations, such as (+,-,*,/,%,=) and has some keywords (FOR, IF, INDEX).

## Examples & Documentation
See testProgram.txt

## Use Cases
None. But it can be fun to play around with.
